## Overview

This repository is a collection of Python implementation of baseline Recommender Systems

## Installation

The code is developed in Python3, and the following Python libraries are required: pandas, numpy, math, pickle. 

As each of the baseline Recommender System has a IPython Notebook version, if you prefer to run the IPython Notebook version, Anaconda will be recommended to obtain a local IPython Notebook environment. 

## Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

**run the python code**

```bash
python3 item-based-collaborative-filtering.py
```

**run the IPython Notebook**

After Anaconda installation, open Anaconda commandline and type the following command to fire up IPython Notebook.

```bash
jupyter notebook
``` 

In the directory of IPython Notebook, open the item-based-collaborative-filtering.ipnb. 

For R : 

1. Modify the setwd path according to your system path for Dataset.
2.Modify the libpath according to the system path to save the R libraries.
